The youtube_auto represents the adaptive video streaming algorithm used by YouTube based on the DASH algorithm. 
The DASH principal consist of dividing video into segments (2-10s), every segments is available in different encoding bitrate or different 
video resolutions, based on the network QoS metrics (e.g., throughput and loss rate) and the terminal display capacity the 
client request segments so as to minimise the video interruptions and limi the video reoslution switches for best visual experience.
We use machine learning to capture the link between the netwrok QoS and the QoE class, our model is built offline 
using controlled experiments. We stream thousands pf videos under network emulated condiitons, latter we record the application 
level QoS such as number of interruption and joint time, then use the ITU-P1203 to derive the corresponding theorticl MoS(mean opinion score). 
We train a decion tree with the data and deploy the model online to do real time prediciton.
